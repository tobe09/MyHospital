            <li><b>From Mr. M</b><br />
                <p>To all of the staff at Neptune hospital.</p>
                "I felt I must write and thank you for the care and consideration shown to me over the last six months, when I have been undergoing various
                 tests in your department. Times like this are always worrying and stressful, but your friendly welcoming attitude and professional and 
                jargon-free communication of results and advice helped make it easier to cope with. Although I have decided not to have any further
                 treatment  at the moment, I would again like to thank you all and say your department has a wonderful team."

            <li><b>From Mrs. N</b><br />
                "I visited Neptune hospital (in November 2008) and I must comment on the quality of service I received and the 
                friendly helpful attitude of all the staff that I came into contact with.  I was very impressed by the organisation, the hygiene, the
                 treatment and the communication."

            <li><b>From Mrs. O</b><br />
                "I have been attending the hospital (3 monthly) via the "Hospital Ambulance Service" so I have had plenty of time  sitting in the waiting
                 area and observing people come and go. I feel that this is one of the most pleasant clinics for patients to come to in Nigeria. 
                 I have experienced a consisitently friendly and cheerful welcome from the receptionist Ann, approachable and encouraging attitudes
                 from the nursing staff, and a positive, caring atmosphere throughout the whole area. Whereas I used to dread hospital visits in general, 
                I don't find it so difficult now mainly due to the "better" experience I have had, and the fact that I have confidence that I will be
                 well-treated in this clinic. Thank you!"

            <li><b>From Mr. P</b><br />
                "On both occasions when I have visited Neptune hospital, my father-in-law and I have been very impressed by the positive atmosphere, 
                friendly and professional attitude of all of the staff.  I do not normally like coming to hospital (for obvious reasons), however, 
                the expert care and attention received in this hospital makes such a great difference.  Keep up the good work!!!"

            <li><b>From Mrs. Q</b><br />
                "I have been a patient in several hospitals, and attended many departments, and I have to say that Neptune hospital comes top 
                in my opinion, for care and consideration.  This includes all doctors and nurses in the department. Last, but certainly not least, 
                is the fact that not once have I heard the words "It's your age", and that, to me is very special."
